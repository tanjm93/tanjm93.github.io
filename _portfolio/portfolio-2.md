The objective of **Object Detection System for Fasteners Identification** is to develop an object detection model to assist in building a robotic disassembly system. Specifically, our developed model is designed to process the image taken by the camera mounted on an industry six-axis robot arm and identify all the bolts to be removed. Thereafter, the model will provide the boltsâ€™ physical coordinates to the robot for automated unbolting.

As a proof-of-concept, a UI has been designed for user to upload an image to be processed. Bolts in the images will be identified along with the coordinates tabulated.

The overall architecture for the application is as depicted in the figure above. The key features of the development include:
- **Camera Intrinsic Calibration:** OpenCV
- **Object Detection:** Fine-tuned YOLOv8m
- **Object Segmentation:** Fine-tuned YOLOv8s-seg
