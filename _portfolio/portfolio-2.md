This application was developed with the objective of improving decision-making through document understanding. In the engineering domain, critical information are often distributed among PDF documents. The process of retrieving and understanding the information from the lengthy document can be very tedious.

In this approach, information are extracted automatically from the PDF documents and integrated into a graph database. GraphRAG pipeline is developed to enable structured retrieval and better decision-making for remanufacturing and disassembly planning.
