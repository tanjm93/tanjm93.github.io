Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is important for many downstream tasks such as quotation generation, processing planning and CAM programming. However, traditional OCR-based methods struggle with complex formatting and specialized symbols.

In this approach, our team proposed a 2 steps pipeline for automated parsing of engineering drawings for structured information extraction.
