The **Intelligent Document Processing System** is an application designed and developed by a group of 3 team members during our Master of Technology in Artificial Intelligence Systems Programme in NUS-ISS. We worked closely with our industry partner which provides the domain expertise to ensure the application would improve engineering manuals understanding for the engineering sector. This project was awarded the best capstone project.

The overall architecture for the application is as depicted in the figure above. The key components and techniques used in the developments include:
- **Image Processing:** Object Detection -- Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet
- **Text Processing:** Named-Entity Recognition (NER) & Vector Embeddings
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
