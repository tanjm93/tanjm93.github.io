👨🏻‍💻 I am a **Research Engineer** at the _Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC), A*STAR_ where I led projects in AI and automation for implementation in the advanced remanufacturing domain. Some of the key developments include information extraction from engineering documents and drawings, knowledge graph creation and GraphRAG application, as well as action recognition from videos.

🎓 I hold an **M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence Systems** from the _National University of Singapore (NUS)_, where my specialization includes Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I also hold a **B.Eng in Aerospace Engineering** from _Nanyang Technological University (NTU)_, providing a strong foundation in engineering principles and systems thinking. This academic journey strengthened my passion for learning, building, and applying AI to meaningful real-world problems.

🌱 Outside of work, I enjoy long road trips, friendly badminton sessions, and spending quality time with my family.
